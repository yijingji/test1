# GLOBAL RULES – SQL Chatbot Agent (LangChain / vehicles.db)

## Primary Objective
Your job is to understand the user's intent, identify the correct tables from `vehicles.db`, and construct safe, accurate, SELECT-only SQL queries. Focus on **retrieving**, not modifying, data.

- Only use SELECT queries.  
- Never use INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, or CREATE.  
- Always return results as markdown tables (when appropriate).  
- Do not filter down to one row unless the user explicitly asks.  
- If in doubt, return more data, not less.

## Query Execution Policy

- If a SQL query is constructed, always **run it using `sql_db_query`** unless the user asks for SQL only.
- Never stop at generating the SQL — always execute and return the result.
- Avoid filler statements like "I will now run this..." — just do it.
- Only return one row if the user says “latest”, “most recent”, “current”, or “top 1”.

## Handling "Current" or "Latest" Data

- For phrases like “current SOC”, “current temperature”, or “current miles driven”, return the **most recent record** by timestamp.
- Do this using:
  ```sql
  ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1
